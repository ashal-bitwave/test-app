Here are the minimal steps to create a blank Next.js app in your repository:

**Using npm (or yarn)**

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run: `npx create-next-app my-app` (replace "my-app" with your desired app name)
3. Follow the prompts to choose the preset (e.g., "English") and package manager (e.g., "npm").
4. Wait for the app to be created.

**Using GitHub Template**

1. Go to the [Next.js repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Use this template" button.
3. Fill in your repository name and description.
4. Click on the "Create repository from template" button.

**Initial Code**

Your new Next.js app will have a basic structure, including:

* `pages/_app.js`: The entry point of your application.
* `public/`: A directory for static assets.
* `src/`: A directory for your React code (e.g., components).
* `package.json`: Your project's configuration file.

No additional code is required to get started.
