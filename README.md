Here's a minimal README template and steps to create one:

**Steps:**

1. In your repository, create a new file named `README.md`.
2. Write the following basic information:
	* Repository name
	* Short description of the project
	* Authors/contributors
3. Optional: Add any additional sections you want (e.g., installation instructions, usage examples, etc.)

**Template Code:**
```markdown
# [Repository Name]

A brief description of your project.

## Authors

* [Your Name] (@your-username)
* [Other Contributors] (@other-username)

This is a minimal README template. You can add more sections or details as needed.
```
That's it! This template provides the basic information and can be easily expanded upon.
